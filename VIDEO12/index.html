    <p style="background-color: pink;">Captain America, whose civilian identity is Steve Rogers, was introduced as a comic book character in Captain America Comics #1, published on December 20, 1940, by Timely Comics, a predecessor to Marvel Comics.
 Created by writer Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby, the character debuted as a frail man who volunteered for a secret government experiment to become a "super-soldier" after being repeatedly rejected for military service due to his small stature and health issues.
 The experiment, led by Dr. Abraham Erskine, transformed Rogers into a peak human specimen, granting him enhanced strength, durability, and athleticism, and he was subsequently dubbed Captain America, clad in a red, white, and blue costume with a shield.</p>
